# Advanced File Processing Implementation 

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the advanced file processing capabilities described in `docs/ADVANCED_FILE_PROCESSING.md`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced File Processing

We've implemented advanced file processing with:

- **Qdrant Vector Database Integration**: Document chunks are now vectorized and stored for semantic search
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added fallback mechanisms when services are unavailable
- **Robust PDF Processing**: Better handling of PDF files with error recovery
- **Batch Processing**: Documents are processed in manageable chunks to prevent memory issues

### 2. File Storage Enhancements

- Added handling for large text files that exceed Redis size limits
- Improved metadata storage in Redis
- Better ID generation for file chunks
- Added tracking of chunk counts and processing status

### 3. Setup Tools

- Created `start-advanced-processing.sh` to easily start required services
- Added documentation in `docs/IMPLEMENT_ADVANCED_PROCESSING.md`
- Updated configuration options in `.env.local`

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Start the required services:
   ```bash
   ./start-advanced-processing.sh
   ```

2. Ensure `USE_ADVANCED_FILE_PROCESSING=true` is set in your `.env.local`

3. Restart your application
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

4. Upload documents in the chat interface

5. Ask questions about the document content - the system will now retrieve semantically relevant chunks

## üîÑ Architecture Changes

Before:
- Files were stored with basic text extraction
- Entire document text was inserted into context window
- No semantic search capabilities

After:
- Documents are chunked intelligently
- Text is vectorized and stored in Qdrant
- Only the most relevant document chunks are included in the context
- Fallback mechanisms ensure reliability

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Verify Redis and Qdrant are running:
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep -E "redis|qdrant"
   ```

2. Check the logs for errors:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs redis qdrant
   ```

3. If on Apple Silicon (ARM64), ensure you have `SKIP_UNSTRUCTURED=true` in your `.env.local`

4. For PDF processing issues, try using a different PDF or running without Docker

## üìù Testing

To verify the implementation:

1. Upload a multi-page PDF document
2. Ask a specific question about content in the document
3. The response should include information from the relevant parts of the document
4. You should see debugging logs showing the semantic search in action
